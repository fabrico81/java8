 * A small frog wants to get to the other side of the road. The frog is currently located at position X and wants to get to a position greater than or equal to Y.
 * The small frog always jumps a fixed distance, D.
 * Count the minimal number of jumps that the small frog must perform to reach its target.
 * Write a function:
 * class Solution { public int solution(int X, int Y, int D); }
 * that, given three integers X, Y and D, returns the minimal number of jumps from position X to a position equal to or greater than Y.
 *
 * Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:
 * X, Y and D are integers within the range [1..1,000,000,000];
 * X â‰¤ Y.
